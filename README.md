The Coding Quiz challenge is used to create a quiz using JavaScript to power the functionality of the web page.  For this challenge the following needs to be included:

1.  A landing page that provides the user with some basic information on the game and allows them to 'start' the process.
2.  A timer that keeps track of the amount of time the user has left (starting at 75 seconds).
3.  Timer is adjusted based on incorrect answers provided - for each incorrect answer, 10 seconds is taken off the timer.
4.  When a question is answered correctly, points are added to your score.
5.  The game is over when all questions have been answered in the alloted time, or when the time reaches 0
6.  Once the game is complete, the user is allowed to save their initials and score into the high scores
